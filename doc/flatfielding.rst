Flat fielding

Overview
========

PypeIt corrects pixel-to-pixel variations using input pixelflat frames
or by loading a pre-made master pixelflat.  The default approach is to
use pixel flat frames and require that several be provided.

Methods
=======

If you are confident that pixel-to-pixel variations do not need to be
corrected for your data, you can turn off the flat fielding correction
with the argument::

    reduce flatfield perform False

Alternatively, set this argument to 'True' (the default option) to
perform the correction. To load a predefined file, use the command::

    reduce flatfield useframe filename

where filename is the name of the file to be used for the flatfield correction.
Alternatively, this command also accepts 'pixelflat' or 'trace' in place of
'filename'. Recall that a trace frame is typically an exposure of a quartz lamp
through the same slit as the science expsoure, and a pixelflat frame is typically
an exposure of a quartz lamp through a slit that is longer than that taken for
the science frame.

If you opt to use a set of flat frames that you have taken for the flat field
correction, the current implementation normalizes the combined
input frames with a bspline::

    reduce flatfield method bspline

Each method takes a set of parameters, which are supplied with the keyword::

    reduce flatfield params [20]

bspline
-------

The bspline method takes a single parameter which, if >= 1, corresponds to
the spacing between knots in the spectral direction, in units of pixels.
If the supplied parameter value is less than 1, PypeIt assumes that this
represents a fraction of the pixels in the spectral direction, and will
use this as the knot spacing. The default value is 0.05.

Blaze information
=================

The blaze functions that are derived from one of the methods listed above
are saved by PypeIt. If desired, you can perform a simple 2D PCA on the
blaze models. This step is only recommended (but not necessary) for
echelle data reduction, where the blaze functions of neighbouring slits
are quite similar. A 2D PCA will not be performed if the argument of the
following keyword is set to zero::

    reduce flatfield 2dpca 0

A number greater than zero will result in a PCA fit to the blaze functions.
The argument of this keyword sets the number of principal components to
use when reconstructing the blaze functions.
