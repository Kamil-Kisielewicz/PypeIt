During the data reduction proceess, PypeIt creates a series
of 2D spectral images prior to extraction of 1D spectra.
And, of course, several of these 2D images may have greater
value for analysis than the 1D spectra.  For each on-source
exposure, PypeIt outputs a series of these images, with the
number set by the :ref:`outputs-reduction-mode`.  
The following table describes the possible products:
